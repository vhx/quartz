## Using in your Application

You can use Quartz either through the Ruby Gem or Bower package.

**Via the Ruby Gem**

1.  Add the VHX Quartz to your Gemfile
```ruby
gem 'vhx-quartz'
```

2.  Then install the gem either via
```shell
bundle install
```
or directly with
```shell
gem install vhx-quartz
```

3. Then include in your layout or SASS files

	a. *In your Layout*

	  Add the following to your `config.rb` file
	```ruby
	sprockets.import_asset 'vhx-quartz.css'
	```

	Then include in your layout directly
	```html
	<%= stylesheet_link_tag  'vhx-quartz' %>
	```

	b. *Or in your SASS files*

	At the top of your file, either via the asset pipeline
	```sass
	//= require vhx-quartz
	```

	Or via a SASS import
	```sass
	@import "vhx-quartz"
	```

### Via the Bower Package

1.  Install Bower via npm if you don't already have it installed
